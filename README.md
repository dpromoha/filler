# filler

The main principle is: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed.

**HOW TO USE:**

make
./resources/filler_vm -f resources/maps/map01 -p1 ./dpromoha.filler -p2 resources/players/grati.filler
